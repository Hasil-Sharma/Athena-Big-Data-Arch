# Setting up N-Node hadoop cluster on EC2

Before proceeding setup trusted ssh between your local computer and between ec2 instances refer to `setup_ssh_trust.sh` to get an idea.

In `constants.sh` mention all the AWS instances. The first instance runs ResourceManager and NodeManager. Rest all auto configured as slaves. This behavior can be changed

When you think ec2 is properly setup, change `$KEY` variable in `constants.sh`, and place your pem key in this directory. This is required to setup ssh trust between ec2 instances.

After all this, issue following command:

``` bash
bash driver.sh setup_ssh_trust.sh download_hadoop.sh add_hadoop_variables.sh setup_core_site.sh setup_hdfs_site.sh setup_mapred_site.sh setup_slaves.sh setup_yarn_site.sh
```
